# Godot Verlet Rope

![](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/godot-verlet-rope/blob/main/rope.gif)

This repo implements a GDExtension that adds a **Rope2D** node, using Verlet Simulation implemented in Rust. **Rope2D** nodes support collisions with both static and rigid bodies.

You can find an example project in the `godot` folder.

## About
This is a project I made to learn more about Rust and GDExtensions. While I might not be actively working on this, I hope this can help you in setting up GDExtensions in Rust, or learn more about Verlet simulations!
